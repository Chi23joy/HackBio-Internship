The cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA ) is  a comprehensive data set of genome information from over 20,000 primary cancer and matches Normal samples of more than 30 cancer types .this a collective collaboration project of the National cancer institute (NCI). 

 ##IMPORTANCE ##

   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is an available resource that provides detailed research regarding various cancer,it is with a goal of improving our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer and advancing our ability to diagnose, treat and prevent cancer. 

(1). DATA RESOURCE: The cancer genome atlas  (TCGA) service as a valuable resource for training Ai  and machines  on the learning model to improve cancer diagnoses and treatment.

(2).BIOMAKER DISCOVERY :The atlas helps identify potential bio marker for early detection diagnosis and prognosis leading to improved the patient outcome.

       EXAMPLES 

 (1). DISCOVERY OF GENETIC MUTATIONS: The cancer genome atlas identifies recurrent genetic mutations in melanoma leading to the development of targeted therapies e.g (BRAF inhibitors )

  (2).INFORMING IMMUNOTHERAPY RESEARCH. The cancer genome atlas data helps the researchers understand the genetic basis of response to immounotherapy to form effective treatments. 

 (  3). DEVELOPMENT OF TARGETED THERAPY: The cancer data informed the development of therapies like Herceptin . Eg(HER2-positive) for breast cancer
